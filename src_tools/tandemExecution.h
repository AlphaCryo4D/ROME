//  Tandem Execution is used to help debug two implementations of an algorithm.
//
//  Consider two implementations, using differing data structures, but going through the same basic steps.
//
//  Run them on one thread each.
//  Have the code execute waypoints at places where the intermediate results should be the same.
//  Run each thread to the first waypoint, have it wait for the other to get there.
//  Compare their intermediate results, to make sure they are the same.
//  Continue until done...
